### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is __Mael__, I'm French, I'm 17 years old, I'm a __young self-taught full-stack web developer__ (_PHP, JS, Symfony, React, HTML, CSS_). I'm mainly interested in development, server installation under _Linux_, their management and maintenance.

ðŸŒ± I'm always learning new technology, new language, currently ___I'm discovering Golang and C___.

ðŸ’¬ I'm on some community such as _Grafikart.fr_, _StackOverflow_, _NaN (Not a Name)_.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my online shop. This one will put on sale some services (*some free, some paying*).

The services will range from a simple ***discord bot***, to applications to manage some ***server side tasks (like automation for example)***, and all my **open source projects** will also be **available** on my shop for ***free***.

This one is **not yet available**, stay tuned.

You can find all my __open source projects__ on my __Github__.
