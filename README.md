### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is __Mael__, I'm French, I'm 17 years old, I'm a __young self-taught full-stack web developer__ (_PHP, JS, Symfony, React, HTML, CSS_). I'm mainly interested in development, server installation under _Linux_, their management and maintenance.

ðŸŒ± I'm always learning new technology, new language, currently ___I'm discovering Golang___.

ðŸ’¬ I'm on some community such as _Grafikart.fr_, _StackOverflow_, _NaN (Not a Name)_.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a program written in Golang allowing the installation of several software from a configuration file.

The Github directory is not yet available, but it will be made public soon.

You can find all my __open source projects__ on my __Github__.
