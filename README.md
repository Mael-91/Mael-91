### Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is __Mael__, I'm French, I'm 17 years old, I'm a __young self-taught full-stack web developer__ (_PHP, JS, Symfony, React, HTML, CSS_). I'm mainly interested in development, server installation under _Linux_, their management and maintenance.

I'm always learning new technology, new language, currently ___I'm discovering Golang___.

I'm on some community such as _Grafikart.fr_, _StackOverflow_.

Today, I'm working on the development of a project to manage the versioning and editing of online files allowing to develop in different languages, all this without having an editor on your PC, just an internet connection.

You can find all my __open source projects__ on my __Github__.
